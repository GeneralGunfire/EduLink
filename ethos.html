      <h1>Goals</h1>
      <p>Hopefully, as more schools and educators turn to our platform for more connectivity with students, our database of resources will grow.</p>
      <p>This means, as time goes on, you will be able to access all of your school's published information and learning material for free. Our only objective is to connect students to reliable information teaching them instead of just giving them answers.</p>

      <h1>Policies</h1>
      <p>This website gives students a safe way to access information and resources. A new password will be generated every week and sent out by your school.</p>
